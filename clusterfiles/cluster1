In the last decades, several viruses emerged, after cross-species passage from animal reservoirs and then spreading in human populations; the Ebola virus, two different coronaviruses causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and the Nipah virus, are paradigmatic examples of biological agents completely new for humans, with high epidemic potential, but also prone to disappear in case early detection and intervention are ensured (Morse 1993; Fauci and Morens 2012) .
Because technologies used for viral discovery can be prohibitively expensive and require a high level of expertise, PREDICT virologists compiled a set of relatively simple and inexpensive protocols for the detection of known and novel viruses within viral families that had previously been recognized in animal hosts and known to cause human disease outbreaks, and coupled this cost-effective approach with the selected application of high through-put sequencing (Anthony et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2013a; Goldstein et al., 2013) .
In this review, we will discuss the host species barrier for these viruses, concentrating on three questions: how does HPAI H5N1 virus transmit from birds to humans; what are the within-host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus and pH1N1 virus in humans and other mammals; and what determines transmission of influenza viruses among humans.
Also, the difference in pattern of virus attachment between HPAI H5N1 virus and seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses fits with the difference in primary disease presentation: tracheo-bronchitis for seasonal human influenza viruses, and diffuse alveolar damage for HPAI H5N1 virus infection.
We used avian influenza viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, to represent inefficiently transmitted viruses; and seasonal human H1N1 virus, seasonal human H3N2 virus, and pH1N1 virus to represent efficiently transmitted viruses [24] .
Four more human coronaviruses have been isolated and described so far: HCoV NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Abdul-Rasool and Fielding, 2010) , HCoV HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a; Lau et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006) , SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , and MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) .
The UbV development platform can also be readily extended to target viruses that infect plants and animals of economic importance, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, equine arteritis virus, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus, all of which encode vDUBs that are essential for virus replication [22] .
Ciliary loss of the upper respiratory tract has also been described in other viral infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‚ÄêCoV in humans (Nicholls et al., 2003), respiratory syncytial virus in humans (Jumat et al., 2015), influenza virus in humans and ferrets (Zeng et al., 2013) and canine respiratory coronavirus in dogs (Mitchell et al., 2013).
