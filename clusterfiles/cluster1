stroke events), behavioral risk factors (factors leading to the increased risk of a health problem because of an action or task) (e.g., needlestick injury surveillance, adverse drug ev
ents), birth defects, chronic diseases, clinical syndromes clustering (because of their potential for bioterrorism), dental caries, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), infectious d
iseases, indicators of the potential for infectious diseases in humans (e.g., surveillance of dead birds in identifying emergence of West Nile Virus), injuries, preventive service util
ization, procedure utilization (e.g., assisted reproductive technology), and health problems whose prevalence is expected to markedly increase over time (e.g., epilepsy) (Centers for D
isease Control, 2008; Chowdhury et al., 2007; Pelletier et al., 2005; Piriyawat et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2008; Zahran et al., 2005) , and other health problems (e.g., nonfatal malt
reatment of infants).
Since then, a number of viral and bacterial antigens have been expressed in a variety of plant species (McGarvey et al., 1995; Thanavala et al., 1995; Carrillo et al., 1998; Gomez et a
l., 1998; Modelska et al., 1998; Tacket et al., 1998; Wigdorovitz et al., 1999) .
The arguments for high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in humans include (a) infection is commonest during the first 3 years of life (Hojlyng et al., 1984; Mathan et al., 1985; Addy an
d Aikins-Bekoe, 1986; Wolfson et al., 1985; Baxby and Hart, 1984) ; (b) outbreaks are uncommon except in daycare centres for the reason mentioned in (a); (c) the disease is less common
 and occurs only sporadically in adults because of frequent previous exposure, not age-related innate resistance, since diarrhoea, when it occurs, can be at least as severe in adults a
s in children (Hunt et al., 1984) ; and (d) the prevalence of diarrhoea appears to be less in neonates compared with infants of 6 months or older (Mata, 1986; Mathan et al., 1985) , be
cause of protection by maternal antibody resulting from the mother's own frequent exposure.

By the early 1960s, many viruses were known to cause tumors in animals (Javier and Butel, 2008) , but none had been identified in human cancers.
For many cases where virus infection has been examined in the context of macrophage depletion, an early/innate role for macrophages in control of the infection has been deduced (Ben-Na
than et al., 1996; Pribul et al., 2008; Rivera et al., 2007; Seiler et al., 1997; Zisman et al., 1970; Zisman et al., 1971) .
However, macrophage depletion also appears to affect the adaptive immune response to some viruses, including ectromelia virus, mouse hepatitis virus A59, and hAd vectors examined in mi
ce (Karupiah et al., 1996; Kuzmin et al., 1997; Kuzmin et al., 2001; Lieber et al., 1997; Shifrin et al., 2005; Wijburg et al., 1997) .
In most infection models using CCR2 -/mice there are increases in replication of the infectious agent compared to control mice, for example, infection with Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococ
cus neoformans, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, mouse cytomegalovirus, and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (Benevides et al., 2008; Blease et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2
001; Dunay et al., 2008; Held et al., 2004; Hokeness et al., 2005; Kurihara et al., 1997; Traynor et al., 2000) .
It was subsequently shown that carbohydrate chains on filovirus GP, especially on the MLR, are recognized by other cellular C-type lectins such as dendritic cell- and liver/lymph node-
specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC/L-SIGN) (Alvarez et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2003a; Marzi et al., 2004; Gramberg et al., 2008), human macrophage galactose
-type C-type lectin (hMGL) (Takada et al., 2004; Matsuno et al., 2010a), and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) (Gramberg et al., 2005; Dominguez-
Soto et al., 2007; Powlesland et al., 2008).
