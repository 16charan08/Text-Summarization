Especially in developing countries including China, ARTIs, mainly pneumonia, are the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 years.1,2 A great variety of pathogens can cause ARTIs, and viruses have been considered as the predominant pathogens in this children population.3,4 The most frequently reported viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (ADV), which are responsible for most episodes of ARTIs in children.1 In the past decade, several new viruses associated with ARTIs such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), novel strains of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HKUI), human bocavirus (BOV), WU polyomavirus (WUPoyV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPoyV) have been discovered in human respiratory tract specimens.
Overall, 48·0% of our cases were positive for respiratory virus infections, which resembled the latest study in the same city.21 A similar incidence rate has been obtained in neighboring regions13,22 and other cities such as Rome23 and Milan,24 but it was different from other studies.10–12 In China, the overall positive rate reported varied from 27·3 to 74·8% depending on different areas and detection methods.15,16,25–31 The rate of respiratory viral infections varied worldwide, and many factors such as geographic distribution, study design and detection protocols could lead to these variations.1,7,8,32 In our study, leukocyte count was used as an indicator of inclusion criteria and it probably affected the positive rate.
However, seasonal distribution was noted from September to February in Hong Kong38 and May and June in Guangzhou.39
The use of multiple PCR made it possible to simultaneously detect a broad spectrum of viruses with excellent sensitivity, at the same time, with increased viral detection rate and co-infection rate for ARTIs.12,40 Among our positive cases, co-infection rate was 31·1%, which was similar to 27·9% reported by Do et al.10 Co-infection rate reported elsewhere varied widely from 25·4 to 47·9%.40 The relatively lower co-infection rates ranging from 0·24 to 26·9% were reported in the studies conducted in various cities of China.22,25–31 In most of these studies, immunofluorescence kits were used to test a lower number of respiratory viruses.

Other protein-derived peptides such as VP22 protein from Herpes Simplex Virus (Elliott and O'Hare, 1997) , pVec (Elmquist et al., 2001) , calcitoninderived peptides (Schmidt et al., 1998; Krauss et al., 2004) , antimicrobial peptides Buforin I and SynB (Park et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000) , as well as polyproline sweet arrow peptide (Pujals et al., 2006) have also been successfully used to improve the delivery of covalently linked cargos (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004; El-Andaloussi et al., 2005; Murriel and Dowdy, 2006) .
For that purpose, several approaches have been described, by using biological reporters (Wadia et al., 2004; Lebleu et al., 2008) or phenotypic (Morris et al., 2007a) assays enabling to follow shuttling and release of the cargo in real time in cultured cells (Lee et al., 2008) or in animal models (Wender et al., 2007) Although it remains difficult to establish a general scheme for CPP uptake mechanism, there is a consensus that the first contacts between the CPPs and the cell surface take place through electrostatic interactions with proteoglycans, and that the cellular uptake pathway is driven by several parameters including: (i) the nature and secondary structure of the CPP; (ii) its ability to interact with cell surface and membrane lipid components; (iii) the nature, type and active concentration of the cargo; and (iv) the cell type and membrane composition ( Figure 1 ).
Moreover, type I IFNs also play important roles in immunoregulation by activating natural killer (NK) cells (Krug et al., 2004a) , modulating the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) (Lapenta et al., 2006; Longman et al., 2007) , B and T cells (Aichele et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2007b; Coro, Chang, and Baumgarth, 2006; Le Bon et al., 2006) , as well as finetuning DC development in the bone marrow (Zuniga et al., 2004) .
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a respiratory pathogen identified by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel test or any other upper respiratory pathogen diagnostic test ordered by the physician; the proportion of patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis; the proportion of patients receiving appropriate anti-influenza treatment or prescription in the ED by an emergency medicine clinician (composite rate of anti-influenza treatment in positive patients and nonuse of anti-influenza treatment in negative patients); the proportion of patients discharged home from the ED vs hospital admission; the proportion of patients with all-cause or respiratory illness-related repeat ED visit, hospital or ICU admission, or death within 30 days; clinician adherence to guidelines for the treatment of patients with influenza (recommendations for use of antivirals only); length of ED stay; length of hospital stay; time to influenza test results; and time to other respiratory pathogen test results.
