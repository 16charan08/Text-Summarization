Paired fecal samples were available from 25 clinically ill chimpanzees (11 from Ngogo and 14 from Kanyawara) during and before (fourth quarter of 2016) the outbreak period, and we tested these for a suite of respiratory pathogens using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) as previously described [10], which tests for influenza virus A (multiple subtypes), human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, coronaviruses (multiple subtypes), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, bocavirus, and the bacterial pathogens Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
On day 4 after infection, we found that higher frequencies of IL-10/GFP+ cells were NK1.1+ TCRb2 (NK cells), as compared to NK1.1+ TCRb+, NK1.12 TCRb2, and NK1.12 TCRb+ cells (NK cells 56%63% compared to NK1.1+ T cells: 5%61%, and non-NK non T cells: 12%61%, and T cells: 27%62%) (Fig.
It is possible that MCMV-specific, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells contribute IL-10 in the liver during this infection, although further characterization of IL-10+ T cells at this site is necessary as regulatory subsets of CD4+ T cells [50] and CD8+ T cells [51, 52] have been shown to also generate IL-10 in various contexts.
A panel of respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus A (pandemic influenza virus H1N1, seasonal influenza A virus H3N2) and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus 1 to 4, human adenovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), human bocavirus, mycoplasma and chlamydia, were also detected in these specimens with commercial real-time RT-PCR kits (cat.
Proliferation index was expressed as the percentage of labelled cells over the total epithelial cells using the following formula:
Proliferation index ¼ number of epithelial labelled cells Â 100=total number of epithelial cells
In the HE-stained sections apoptotic cells were identified using the following morphological criteria: cell shrinkage, acidophilic cytoplasm and condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin.
Our laboratory policy as well as recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization for a positive test result include the following: for a positive RT-PCR result, repeat the test using a second aliquot of the original specimen, and if positive, confirm the result by sending the specimen to a reference labo-ratory; or test the positive specimen by a second RT-PCR test targeting a different part of the genome, and if positive, confirm by a reference laboratory (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/f/pdf/app2.pdf).
Interestingly, using duck influenza A viruses to infect human airway epithelial cells, the viral antigen could only be detected in the ciliated cells, but not in the goblet cells, possibly due to the low SAα2–3Gal expression on the surface of goblet cells and a low MOI infection [19], [20].
Each assay was run in microtiter plates containing cell control wells (cells only), virus control wells (cells + virus), drug toxicity wells (cells + drug only), drug background wells (drug only) and experimental wells (drug or positive control + cells + virus).
