Reinvigorating downregulated adaptive immunity during established chronic infections likely bears a lower risk of provoking pathological levels of proinflammatory cytokines or the excessive killing of infected cells than treating during acute infections at the peak of pathogendirected immune responses due to reduced numbers of antiviral T cells and multiple mechanisms of T cell downregulation, which are present in established chronic viral infections [17, [73] [74] [75] .
Cleaning is related to the clearance of foreign material from a surface or equipment, allowing the removal of some organic material and microorganisms by detergents.11,33 However, this process does not kill bacteria, which, under favourable conditions, can redeposit elsewhere and form biofilms.31 Consequently, cleaning must always precede disinfection and sterilization in order to eliminate infectious microorganisms.59 A significant amount of microorganisms is destroyed by the disinfection process, which involves the use of chemical agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds, aldehydes, alcohols and halogens, or radiation and heat.11,31,33,60 The control of hospital infection must involve both disinfection and sterilization processes and sometimes the use of aerosols to clean the air.11,33
A biocide can target different locations on a cell as it may interact with the surface, the bacterial cell wall and the outer membrane, or it may penetrate the cell, where it can cause reversible or irreversible changes by interacting with nucleic acids, inhibiting enzymes and cell growth.24,60 When choosing a disinfectant, several factors must be taken into account, such as its efficiency, compliance with regulations, user acceptability, instrument compatibility, the types of surfaces and medical equipment, and the pathogenicity, infection rates and persistence of the microorganisms.61 A disinfectant must be safe, easy to use and effective against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and should not leave toxic residues.31,61 The efficiency of the disinfectant depends on several factors, mainly surface characteristics (hydrophobicity, charge and roughness), the amount of organic and inorganic matter, temperature, pH, the chemical structure of the biocidal agent and the type of infection and pathogen.11,24,31 The mode of action of the disinfectant and the route of entry into the cell (porin channels in the case of hydrophilic disinfectants and the hydrophobic path for hydrophobic disinfectants) also play significant roles.24 The risk of infection of the room/surface/equipment must also be considered in the choice of the disinfectant, as well as its concentration and exposure time.24,62 Hospital areas should be defined according to the risk of infection in order to establish and promote proper cleaning/disinfection.
Alcohols such as ethanol have a long history of antiseptic use; around the 19th and 20th centuries phenolics and hypochlorites started to be employed and, later, quaternary ammonium compounds.66 More recently, the most common products have been chlorhexidine and silver salts, peroxygens, glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde.66,67
Alcohol disinfectants cause protein denaturation and are effective against vegetative bacteria, fungi and viruses, but have no effect on spores.61,68 Chlorine-releasing agents can oxidize membrane proteins and are very effective in removing biofilms from surfaces, requiring short exposure times for growth inhibition.57,61,68 However, these chemical agents are corrosive to metals and can be inactivated by the presence of organic matter.57,61,69 Moreover, in the last few years the use of chlorine has been associated with the formation of carcinogenic compounds and some pathogens have been shown to be resistant to chlorine.70 The aldehyde-based disinfectants disrupt proteins and nucleic acids by alkylation and have antimicrobial activity against spores, bacteria, viruses and fungi.61,64 Quaternary ammonium compounds and phenols solubilize the membrane and the cell wall.68 Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid promote protein denaturation, and are active against several groups of microorganisms and pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections.38,57,61,64 The mechanism of action of different disinfectant categories has been presented elsewhere in greater detail.64,71,72
Countless studies have been performed regarding the antimicrobial action and efficacy of different disinfectants.
Using proteomic and microarray analyses Cameron et al [22] showed that individuals who survived SARS-CoV infection had controlled innate immune, ISG and cytokine responses while individuals who progressed to severe disease demonstrated an uncontrolled innate immune response, with high levels of ISG and immunoglobulin expression, increased cytokine responses and poor antibody responses to the spike protein.
Therefore, studies in our and other laboratories suggest that VLPs are a promising approach as evidenced in preclinical studies for developing vaccines against viral pathogens including HIV-1, influenza, poliovirus, rotavirus, Ebola, Marburg, Norwalk virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003; Deml et al., 2005; Galarza et al., 2005; Grgacic and Anderson, 2006; Lobue et al., 2006; Mortola and Roy, 2004; Pushko et al., 2005; Quan et al., 2007a; Sun et al., 2009; Warfield et al., 2005) .
