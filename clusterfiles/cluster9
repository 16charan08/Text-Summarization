The differentiate equations of our modified SIR model is as follows:
Where is the total local population derived from the census data, and represents the total population with Wuhan travel history during January 1 to January 24, estimated from mobile phone data; I is the number of infections, and denote the daily transmission rate and daily recovery rate respectively.
In our model, four variables need to be initialized: (1) initial number of infectious 0 , treated as a parameter to be estimated (see next section); (2) initial number of local susceptible 10 , equal to the total number of the local population of each city 10 = ; (3) initial number of susceptible traveling from Wuhan 20 , equal to the population from Wuhan excluding the initial infectious 20 = − 0 ; and (4) initial number of removed 0 , assuming no cured, hospitalized, or death at initial state 0 = 0.
To reduce mosquito processing cost, footprint, and time for this large study, we 358 further simplified sample preparation requirements by optimizing the "in-tube" mosquito 359 preparation method wherein each mosquito was crushed with a micropestle directly in a 360 microcentrifuge tube followed by resuspension in water and introduction in a LAMP-OSD 361
The visually read coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity (true positive rate) 363 of 97% and specificity (true negative rate) of 98% when compared to morphological typing of 364 field-caught mosquito species (Fig 4, S6, S7, S8) .
Infections among colleagues and family members, who do not have a recent travel history to Wuhan, and also among health care workers confirm the human-to-human transmission (Bastola et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020) .
In this study, the date of exportation is defined as the date the individual exits Wuhan (local time, 49 cases), and when the exit date is not available, the symptom onset date was used (4 cases), and when both the exit date and the onset date were not available, the confirmation date was used instead (4 cases).
Of the 40 cases, on which both the date existing Wuhan and the symptom onset date were available, 57.5% (23 cases) were asymptomatic when leaving Wuhan, 25% (10 cases) developed symptoms before leaving Wuhan, and 17.5% (7 cases) developed symptoms on the same date when leaving Wuhan.
1101 where S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) were the number of susceptible, latent, infected and removed individuals in the population at time t, respectively, N(t) is the total number of individuals in the population, R 0 is the basic reproductive number, L ij (t) is the daily number of individuals migrating from i to j, for i, j ∈{w: Wuhan, i: international, c: other cities of China}, and z(t) is the daily force of zoonotic infection.
The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average, which is significantly smaller than previous estimates (Read et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) , probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset.
