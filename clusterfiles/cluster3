Shenzhen's GDP was 1750.3 billion yuan in 2015, up 8.9%-the tertiary industry rapidly developed-its annual added value was 1,029,180 million yuan, up 10.2%, accounting for 58.8% of Shenzhen's GDP, up 1.5 percentage points compared with the previous year; the modern service industries delivered added value amounting to 713,447 million yuan, up 11.6%, accounting for 69.32% of the tertiary industry, up 1.72 percentage points; the real estate industry grew the most rapidly among the modern service industries, its annual added value was 162,777 million yuan, up 16.8%; the financial industry witnessed a relatively rapid growth, its annual added value was 254,282 million yuan, up 15.9%; as one of the four pillar industries, including the financial industry, cultural industry, and new and high-tech industry in Shenzhen, the logistics industry delivered an annual added value amounting to 178,270 million yuan, up 9.4%.
There have been many reports of recombination between other vaccine strains and circulating wild strains, including a PMV-1 (Chong et al., 2010), bovine viral diarrhea virus (Becher et al., 2001) and infectious bursal disease virus (Hon et al., 2008), raising concern that modified live virus vaccines, although efficacious, may facilitate the emergence of new strains through recombination with circulating viruses.
Included studies were further classified into five groups based on the study design and population studied: (i) case reports comprising published studies that described the clinical course of individual patients including mild cases; (ii) studies including only ICU cases (hereafter referred to as ICU studies): case reports or retrospective studies that reported outcomes of patients admitted to the ICU only; (iii) hospital studies: retrospective or descriptive studies that aimed to document the outbreak in a hospital or healthcare-associated facility; (iv) retrospective studies: published studies that retrospectively analyzed the series of MERS cases that were registered in the patient database or tracked medical records; and (v) surveillance studies: published studies that extracted data from a database of cases, systematically gathering epidemiological data, as coordinated by a country or WHO.
Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit various human viruses in vivo and in vitro, including influenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV-1, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus 71, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus 16, polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus ( [123, 124] for review).
These pathogens, all zoonotic, include the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Ebola and Marburg viruses (EBOV), Lassa virus (LASV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Nipah virus (NiV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV).
Target pathogens include HIV [24,15,25,16,17,26e28] , West Nile Virus (WNV) [29, 30] , dengue virus (DENV) [31, 32] , hepatitis B virus (HBV) [33] , human papilloma virus (HPV) [34] , CHIKV [21] , NiV [35] , respiratory syncytia virus (RSV) [36] , SARS-CoV [37] , MERS-CoV [18] , H5N1 influenza A virus (IAV) (unpublished), ZIKV (unpublished), LASV (unpublished) and EBOV (unpublished).
The Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission will discuss disruptive factors and how preparedness planning must consider this new ecology by exploring current preparedness platforms and their vulnerability to disruptive factors; by addressing key disruptions, iden tifying possible solutions, and providing recommendations for countries to strengthen preparedness; by developing a multidisciplinary approach including
National governments; international agencies; non-governmental organisations and charities; corporate entities; academic institutions Weakness in behavioural change guidance from national and international organisations; scarcity of sustainable leadership and financing in failed states leading to neglected or uncoordinated health systems; increasing duration and frequency of insecurity or conflict zones hindering efforts to recognise and respond to health threats; failure of countries to report disease outbreaks because of fear of economic consequences Social Travel patterns, migration, and interconnectivity; trade; technology and digital revolution, including those that affect human interaction; expansion and control of information; patterns of communication including social media; expectations and definition of expertise; social conflict and privacy
Failure of host countries to protect the health of refugees and migrants; epidemic of devastating rumours and fake news on social media due to increased digital connectivity; emergence of social influencers exerting influence on politicians and institutions; increased resistance and hesitancy within communities to health interventions because of opposition by local experts Environment Geography affecting biological diversity; planned and unplanned urbanisation; climate change; interaction between humans, animals, and vectors; human development; state of the economy; state of health systems Climate change resulting in increased flooding with failed sanitation and safe water; altered distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs and vectors; emerging zoonosis with increased agricultural production and human encroachment into animal environments; changing national priorities resulting in sharply reduced investment in health systems Pathogenesis Changing disease biomes; relationship between hosts and pathogens; pathogen evolution and changes; technologies such as synthetic biology, and the risks of manufacturing pathogens and their accidental or deliberate release; characteristics of a population such as underlying disease condition Increased opportunities for mutation or reassortment of infectious agents; increasingly reduced effectiveness of conventional vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of diseases; failure of conventional control measures to break the chain of transmission of infectious agents To tackle the wide-ranging issues, the Commission has brought together experts from academic, public health, policy making, international, non-governmental, and corporate institutions.
Torrents de la Pe√±a and Sanders Retrovirology (2018) 15:63 Recently, high-resolution structures of other viral glycoproteins were solved, including those of human parainfluenza virus 5, ebola virus, lassa virus, human betacoronavirus HKS1, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [92, [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] .
