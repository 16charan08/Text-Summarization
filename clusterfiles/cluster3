To determine whether hematopoietic cell lines can support replication of Sabin poliovirus type 1, cells were infected with an MOI of 1 and cells together with supernatant were harvested at day 3 (for all virus passages in Vero cells and for passages 3-5 on U937 cells) or day 6 after infection.
Since we already observed that also other Sabin poliovirus types are capable of replicating in the permissive three cell lines (Oosterhoff et al., unpublished data) and that all cell lines express other viral receptors, needed for efficient infection with rhinovirus, coxsackie, adenovirus, and hepatitis C virus, it would thus be interesting to determine the capacity of these viruses to replicate in these cell lines.
The dynamic and multifunctional nucleolar proteome enables ribosome subunit biosynthesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA replication/repair, RNP biogenesis, and stress response within subnucleolar compartments—fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar components (DFC), and outermost granular components (GC).24,25
Viral pathogenesis induces cellular stress, leading to transformation in nucleolar proteomic morphology as nucleolar-accessible viral proteins recruit replication factors.26,27 Similar to HIV-1 Rev, the following single-strand RNA viruses express nucleolar RNA binding proteins of diverse functionality: severe acute respiratory coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) harbors an NES predicted in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity28; dengue virus core protein facilitates encapsidation and potentially modulates transcription29; and the Semliki Forest virus nonstructural protein (nsP2) regulates viral mRNA synthesis.30
Although nucleolar trafficking is prevalent in many viral infectious models, the purpose of this localization pattern is unknown.
In a wastewater sample spiked with viruses, the nondimensional concentration of infective viruses in the wastewater liquid C l,ww * is related to the fraction of viruses inactivated in the liquid phase (ξ 1 *), and the fraction reversibly adsorbed to wastewater solids (ξ 2 *):
The change of the viral fraction in the liquid and solid phases with time can be described with the following set of differential equations:
where, ξ 3 * is the fraction of viruses inactivated on the solid surface; τ is the nondimensional time, equal to k 1 t; n sro * is the initial amount of viruses reversibly adsorbed to solids (assumed zero in the study); N b = k 2 /k 1 , where k 2 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for reversible virus adsorption; N s = (k 3 +k 4 )/k 3 , where k 3 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for virus inactivation at the solid surface and k 4 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for the conversion of reversibly adsorbed viruses to an irreversibly adsorbed state;
is the rate constant for virus desorption from solid phase to liquid phase, W (g) is the mass of solids, and V (L) is the liquid volume.
The antiviral assays [except anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assays] were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in HEL [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Coxsackie B4, and Punta Toro virus), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus), MDCK (influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and B virus) and CrFK (feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus) cell cultures.
These include: (1) primary inefficient transmission via sexual and transplacental routes but effective transmission via blood; (2) primary replication in renewable populations of lymphoidal cells with production of large amounts of virus after the initial infection of the host followed by persistent low level of viremia in spite of antiviral immune responses; (3) persistence, reflecting continuous rounds of productive, cytocidal infection of permissive cells [59, 74] and the rate of generation of permissive cells which may be the main factor in determining the level of virus production (in the case of HIV, the rate of activation of CD4 § T cells to support a productive HIV replication might be the factor determining the rate of virus production and the progression of the disease); (4) rapid antibody formation but delayed production of neutralizing antibodies with limited neutralizing capacity; (5) rapid but transient generation of virus-specific CTLs; and (6) accumulation of large amounts of virus in newly formed germinal centers in the spleen and lymph nodes concomitant with an initiation of a permanent polyclonal activation of B cells resulting in an elevation of plasma IgG2a.
For the lectin array analysis, cells (C6/36 cells, Vero cells, SNB-19 cells, and JEG-3 cells) grown until they reached 60–70% confluency were incubated with various ZIKV strains, such as African strains (MR766 and IbH), Asian strains (PRVABC59 and FLR), and the primary Brazilian isolate SJRP, at MOI of 1 in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 90 min, and control uninfected (no virus added) cells were maintained under similar conditions.
After the infection (similar infection conditions were followed), the uninfected cells and ZIKV-infected cells, separately, were harvested using cell scrapper, made into a single cell suspension, and counted using cell countess (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
