By incorporating a 'delay to ICU' parameter within our model, that can take on negative values (thus indicating a diagnosis after ICU admission), we hope to have replicated the anecdotal experience of clinicians in these early phases of the pandemic; that a substantial proportion of patients are being con- forecast numbers as these data inform our standardised estimates of ICU cases from within each population [9] .
If China's policies aimed at achieving suppression represent a maximum possible reduction in transmission from initially high rates, then estimates based on their curve will undercount both the total deaths and maximum death rates for other countries and hence represent a reasonable lower bound for modelling: the lowest estimate of total deaths in the models in Ferguson et al.
Scientists also believe that peri-domestic mammals may also serve as For long, human viruses have not been considered severe pathogens as infected people develop flu like symptoms and then get cured on their own as innate immune system triggers antibody formation that provides resistance against the diseases (Chiu, 2013; Kistler et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008) .
al [34] , the reproduction number of the disease for the 187 vaccinated SIR model is given by to the existence of another compartment I 2 for those who are infected with the new 196 strain, which we will refer to as Disease 2.
19.20039198 doi: medRxiv preprint of the second strain, the proportion of the population infected by the original strain, i 1 , 368 and the proportion of the individuals who recovered from the original strain, r 1 , 369 decrease and go to zero asymptotically.
Based on the stability of the first three equilibrium points 387 and the existence criterion, the endemic equilibrium point is expected to be stable when 388
This implies that the endemic equilibrium for the two strains can only occur when 389 the system is initially in endemic equilibrium for the original strain, which can explain 390 why the condition is more restrictive than the one for the equilibrium with Disease 2. .
After establishing the possible transitions between compartments, the 459 system was found to have four equilibrium points: the disease free equilibrium, the 460 existing strain equilibrium, the emergent strain equilibrium, and the endemic 461 equilibrium.
495
Based on the results, we found that the original and the emergent strain can coexist in 496 an endemic equilibrium if the emergent strain has a lower reproduction number than 497 the original strain and that the system should already be in endemic equilibrium with 498 the original disease before the emergence.
