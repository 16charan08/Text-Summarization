To improve the public health care, the Ministry of Health instituted eleven basic items of public health services in 2009, including the establishment of residents' health assessments, health education, health care of children, maternity patients, elderly and patients suffering from hypertension, type II diabetes and severe psychosis, vaccine inoculation and immunization, response to public health emergencies and assistance in sanitary control [16] .
However, since (1) the interactions between the 5′ and 3′ end of the genome facilitated by RNA or/and protein to form the replication complex and thereby to initiate replication have been well documented in numerous of RNA viruses [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54] and (2) the results from this study that the mutations in the 3′-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA were able to alter the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis, we postulate that the sequence mutations in the 3′-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA [5′ terminal region of (−)-strand DI RNA] may hinder the binding of proteins to this region and then block the interactions between the 5′ and 3′ end of the (−)-strand genome to constitute the replication complex that is required for (+)-strand synthesis.
Only one, Global Point of Care: Strategies for Disasters, Emergencies, and Public Health Resilience, contributed by 105 authors and produced by the POCT•CTR (10), covers POCT topics relevant to public health and vice-versa, such as biohazards, community preparedness, disaster caches, geographic information systems, global resilience, national guidelines, molecular diagnostics (an extensive seven-chapter section), needs assessment, rapid diagnosis of critically ill patients with life-threatening diseases, POC culture, public health policy, and strategies for enhancing resilience.
Not all public health educational programs, per se (identified by “PHP” in Table 2), were included in the survey, but on the other hand, 100% of 59 U.S. schools of public health, colleges of public health, and public health schools accredited by the CEPH were accessed and assessed successfully, and 100% of the states in the U.S. with public health educational programs were represented.
Accordingly, the statement asked stakeholders to commit to 1) sharing public health surveillance data by default when a public health need is identified; 2) using public health surveillance data responsibly, with the intention of protecting and improving the health of the population; 3) making the benefits explicit; 4) ensuring that public health surveillance data are shared with as few restrictions as possible and in an ethical way.
9 They contracted the disease after tracheal intubation of patients with respi- -high fever (> 38°C) AND -cough or breathing difficulty AND one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms:
-close contact B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS 2 A person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death after 1 November 2002, A but on whom no autopsy has been performed AND one or more of the following exposures during to ten days prior to onset of symptoms:
-close contact, B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS; -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS Probable case 1 A suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest
x-ray (CXR).
Briefly, these guidelines state that a person who meets the following criteria will have their travel restricted [114]:
Be known or likely infectious with, or exposed to, a communicable disease that poses a public health threat AND meet one of the following three criteria:Be unaware of diagnosis, noncompliant with public health recommendations, or unable to be located.ORBe at risk for traveling on a commercial flight, or internationally by any means.ORTravel restrictions are warranted to respond effectively to a communicable disease outbreak or to enforce a federal or local public health order.
The modules included: 1) early detection of priority diseases and other health events; 2) reporting of public health events; 3) analysis and interpretation of data generated through the surveillance system; 4) early detection of unusual changes in disease occurrence; 5) investigation and control of outbreaks, 6) response to outbreaks and other public health events; 7) communication and 8) monitoring and evaluation to improve surveillance and response.
