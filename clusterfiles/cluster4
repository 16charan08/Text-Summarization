Because Pin1 has been implicated in different viral infections and has been shown to bind pS/T–P motifs within viral proteins from hepatitis B virus [68], human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 [69,70], human immunodeficiency virus 1 [71,72,73], Epstein–Barr virus [74], and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [75], it may represent an interesting host target for further study in the context of the arenavirus Z protein.
Even though numbers of AMs (CD11c ϩ SiglecF ϩ cells in Figure 4B ) remained significantly lower in PBS-dosed mice until 48 and 72 hours after infection, the numbers of DCs (CD11c ϩ SiglecF Ϫ cells in Figure 4B and CD11c ϩ MHCII high cells in Figure  4C ) in these mice increased rapidly at 12 hours after infection and significantly exceeded the numbers of DCs in PCN-dosed mice at later points after infection ( Figure  4B and Table 1 ).
In the analyzed sequence of the fourteen viruses in this study, amino acid mutations associated with virus tropism were identified at positions 38 (38N in only one virus while 38T in thirteen viruses) and 69 (69S in seven viruses and 69A in seven viruses) in the S1 protein of the variant strains.
(TIF) Figure S3 Detection of H3N2 influenza viruses in EBC samples collected from three human subjects with ID: 1, 2, 3 corresponding to those listed in Table S2 ; In addition, spiked H3N2 virus samples were also amplified; H3N2 viruses were used as the positive control and DI water was used as the negative control.
In this study, we established a method that was able to simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens rapidly and effectively, including bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer (EHDV), Q-fever pathogen Coxiella burnetii (CB), African swine fever virus (ASFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), Borrelia burgdorferi (BB), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Ebola virus (EBV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV).
Day (−1): Plating CellsGrow Hep-2 cells to ~80% confluence in T-162 flasks in 50 mL of Hep-2 media (see
Note
7).Remove old media and wash cells aggressively twice with 10 mL of 1 × PBS pre-warmed to 37 °C.Add 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin and aggressively rock back and forth to allow removal of adhered cells from the flask (see
Note
8).Neutralize the 0.25% trypsin by adding 8 mL of Hep-2 medium (total volume of 10 mL) and pipette up and down several times.Take an aliquot for cell counts, and then dilute the cell suspension in Hep-2 media to achieve a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL (see
Note
9).Aliquot 2 mL of diluted Hep-2 cells into each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate to achieve 1 × 106 cells per well, and immediately shake the plate front to back and side to side to disperse the cells evenly (see
Note
10).Place the plate in the 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator to be ready the following day.

Molecular mimicry can cause several immune-mediated disease such as Grave's disease (Kohn et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001) , Insulin-dependent diabetes (Rose and Mackay, 2000; Hiemstra et al., 2001) , Multiple sclerosis (Banki et al., 1994; Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995; Appelmelk et al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1996; Rose and Mackay, 2000) , Peptic ulcer (Appelmelk et al., 1996) , Rheumatoid arthritis (Tiwana et al., 1999; Balandraud et al., 2004; Bridges, 2004) , Systemic lupus erythematosus (Rönnblom and Alm, 2001; Kaufman et al., 2003; McClain et al., 2005) , Myocarditis (Neu et al., 1987; Huber et al., 1994; Gauntt et al., 1995; Schulze and Schultheiss, 1995; Ang et al., 2004) , and cancer as well, by modulating key signaling pathways, such as those involving Ras (Guven-Maiorov et al., 2016) .
