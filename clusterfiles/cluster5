To map the data exported from Scopus into a co-authorship network, the following algorithm was developed where its variables are presented below:
• Max-No-Papers Maximum number of papers in the database with known authors • Max-No-Aut-Paper Maximum number of authors in a paper in the database • Max-No-authors Maximum number of authors in the database • List-All-Authors A list containing the name of all the authors in the database • List-Max-No-Authors-Per-Paper A list indicating the maximum number of authors for each paper in the database • List-All-Papers-with-All-their-Authors A list of all authors for each paper in the database • Co-authorship-Initial A matrix with the size of (Max-No-Papers, Max-No-Aut-Paper) that its cell (i,j) indicates whether author j in List-All-Authors participated in writing paper i in the database • Weighting A matrix with its cell (i,j) indicating the number of papers wrote by authors i and j in List-All-Authors • Co-authorship A matrix with its cell (i,j) indicating whether authors i and j in List-All-Authors wrote a paper together or not
In order to build the network of collaborating countries, the affiliation records of each publication were processed to extract the countries cited.
As more and more cats are kept as pets in many countries, studies of cats in the home setting and studies comparing the welfare of indoor-only cats with that of cats allowed outdoors, are urgently needed.Global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have led many countries to reinforce the entry screening systems at their international airports, ports, and border lines as a way to prevent or delay the spread of infectious diseases across countries [1-4].
Interestingly, although there were significantly more young TCR Tg CD4 + cells in mice receiving young cells at day 7 after immunization, by day 14, the numbers of young and aged donor cells were equivalent; thus, differences in the numbers of helper T cells at this time point could not account for these results, suggesting differences in the ability to provide cognate help to B cells between young and aged CD4 + cells.
Outbreak investigations for any infectious or toxicant-induced disease involve an orderly process of characterizing the outbreak and finding solutions using epidemiologic concepts that include the following:
Interviewing key individuals Verifying the clinical diagnosis and assure that treatments are appropriate
Identifying the factors responsible for the outbreak using a rational diagnostic plan and qualitative or quantitative analytical methods Developing strategies to prevent new cases and future outbreaks by identifying corrective actions likely to have the most impact without excessive cost Communicating observations and recommendations with the key individuals, and using records to verify compliance and monitor progress.Harm reduction became the policy of choice when the 2004 Health Statistics of Taiwan identified injection drug users (IDUs) as the most rapidly expanding subgroup of newfound HIV-positive cases.
The baseline (HBM) model is a recursive, two-stage model:
Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility information, of personal sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention to get vaccinated ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
The alternate model we want to test is also a recursive, two-stage model:
Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
Note that stage 1 is the same for both baseline and alternative models.
Our final model (Table 2) included the following parameters for the date on which each faecal sample was collected: (1) the number of younger juveniles present at the communal den, the most naïve age class to Dipylidium infection; (2) the number of adults and older juveniles present at the communal den as an index of the number of adult fleas brought to the den and of the flea eggs these fleas were likely to shed at the den; (3) maternal standardised rank as an index of juvenile body resources; (4) prey abundance (3 levels: high, medium and low) as an index of current maternal input in terms of the interval between visits to nurse offspring at the den; and (5) juvenile age in days.
When fitting the models we penalized these regions of parameter space by arbitrarily assigning a deviation between model and data of 500 d.
We used the stochastic model to consider the effects of (i) reducing local transmission (this simulates the effects of isolation, behaviour changes, antiviral use, or other measures that may reduce the average number of secondary cases produced by one primary case); and (ii) restricting travel to and from affected cities.
We considered a number of other scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the results to the most important unknowns: patterns of seasonal variation in influenza transmission; variation in transmissibility between tropical and temperate regions; the proportion of individuals initially susceptible to the virus; the basic reproduction number, R 0 (defined as the mean number of secondary cases in a local and susceptible population caused by the introduction of one primary case); the distribution of the infectious period; the city in which the pandemic begins; and the date on which the virus first begins to spread.
