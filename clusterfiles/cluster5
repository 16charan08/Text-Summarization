Our data that dsRNA accumulation and activation of dsRNA-responsive host defenses in VacV-infected cells (i) are controlled by the major cellular mRNA exonuclease and (ii) are dependent upon a viral transcription factor required for the biogenesis of a specific class of mRNAs in Xrn1-depleted cells provide key biological support for the hypothesis that dsRNA comprised of viral mRNA duplexes activates PKR and RNase L.
In addition to E3L, a dsRNA binding protein that also inhibits RNase L (Chang et al., 1992; Rivas et al., 1998) , and the eIF2a pseudosubstrate K3L (Seo et al., 2008) , we show that VacV-encoded decapping enzymes required to accelerate mRNA turnover in infected cells also individually control eIF2a phosphorylation in infected primary human cells.
Significantly more apoptotic cells were observed in Mcl-1 knockdown cells infected with IBV compared to the control cells transfected with siEGFP, or with Bak-knockdown cells at both 20 and 24 hours post-infection, whereas little or no apoptotic cells were observed in mock-infected cells (Fig.
While the expression of IBV-S protein in total cell lysates showed little or no increase in IBV infected H1299 (96%) and Huh 7 (90) cells over-expressing Bak as compared to similarly infected control cells, an increase in the release of virus proteins/particles was observed, as is evident in the increase in IBV-S and -N protein expression levels in the culture medium of infected H1299 (2.1-fold for S protein and 2.3fold for N protein) and Huh7 (1.43-fold for S protein and 1.54fold for N protein cells) transfected with Myc-Bak (Fig.
A variety of herbal preparations have shown potentials for inhibiting viruses that cause serious infections among humans, such as measles viruses (Olila et al., 2002) , human rotaviruses (HRV) (Husson et al., 1994; Takahashi et al., 2001) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinoviruses (Glatthaar-Saalmuller et al., 2001) , the coxsackie group of viruses (Evstropov et al., 2004; Su et al., 2006) , neurotropic Sindbis virus (NSV) (Paredes et al., 2001) , and various strains of polio virus (Andrighetti-Frohner et al., 2005; Melo et al., 2008) .
The cell pellets are dissolved in NaOH and diluted , TZM-bl cell-based assay (HIV), CEM-green fluorescent protein cell-based assay (HIV), Hep AD38 assay (HBV), immunofluorescence assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) • Reduction or inhibition of virus-specific polypeptides synthesis in infected cell cultures, e.g., viral nucleic acids, determination of the uptake of radioactive isotope labeled precursors or viral genome copy numbers
Other assays for validation of antiviral activity
• Virus inactivation assay, virus adsorption assay, virus attachment, and penetration assay to 0.1 N. The test drug is to be added to 200 μL of protein sample, mixed, and left for 10 min.
Several members have previously been found to be active against HIV-1 and/or HIV-2, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), but not against several other DNA viruses including herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus and vaccinia virus or against RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus, reovirus-1, polio virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Semliki forest virus and parainfluenza virus.16 Surprisingly, the pyridine N-oxides were now also found inhibitory against coronaviruses, in particular against the feline coronavirus type II strain of FIPV and the SARS coronavirus strain Frankfurt-1.
The Baltimore classification of viruses establishes the following categories according to the genetic material contained in the virion: positive-strand RNA viruses (e.g., rhinoviruses, hepatitis C virus, noroviruses, tobacco mosaic virus), negative-strand RNA viruses (influenza viruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus), double-strand RNA viruses (rotaviruses, bursal disease virus), retroviruses (HIV, human T cell leukemia virus), para-retroviruses (hepatitis B viruses), single-stranded DNA viruses (parvoviruses, bacteriophage /X174), and double-stranded DNA viruses (papillomaviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses).
We have demonstrated that binase reduced the titer of pandemic influenza A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1pdm), reovirus serotype 1 (Reo 1-Lang), herpes virus type I (pseudorabies), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human corona virus (HCoV-229E) in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) epithelial cells, human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC5) cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cells, respectively [9] [10] [11] .
