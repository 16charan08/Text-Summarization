## Summarized Data

### This markdown contains summarized sentences for each cluster.

#### Steps in summarizing data.
**step1:-** Best "k" value will be obtained from knee-elbow curve. \
**step2:-** This "k" value will be passed to summarize data function. This function initially forms cluster based on "k" value given and labels for each document are appended to original dataframe. By grouping labels, "data_text" column is joined together. So finally we will be having only "k" number of rows in dataframe with each row representing each cluster in order. \
**step3:-** Dataframe containing clusters will be parsed to do sentense tokenization and then sentense normalization for each sentense separately.This done by looping through dataframe, so it is done for each cluster at a time. \
**step4:-** After getting normalized sentences data vectorized(countvectorization) and matrix is returned.\
**step5:-** Matrix returned from vectorization will be used along with its "Transpose" to get similarity matrix(matrix x matrix.T).\
**step6:-** This similarity matrix is used to get scores of each sentense using "Text Ranking" algorithm which is from "networkx" package.\
**step7:-** From this scores are sorted and top 8 scores are selected to get indices from our original sentences list.\
**step8:-** Finally, using above indices top 8 sentences of each cluster are written into separate file. Thus at the end of the execution we will be having summarized text of each cluster in each file. 

#### Assumption: - Sentences are tokenized using sent_tokenize from nltk, so sentences in each cluster are according to this tokenization which in some clusters may not be appropriate.
#### Total clustered formed for 1% of data .i.e nearly 600 files are "9". I have tried to run this for 10% of data which is computationaly expensive,I have increased size of instance even though it kept on running straight 13 hours and didn't even get best clusters. So, I am attaching summarized sentences for only 1% data.

"Taken as a whole, studies suggest that MDD is associated with all the cardinal features of an inflammatory response including increased proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors and increased acute phase reactants, chemokines, and soluble adhesion molecules in peripheral blood (Lieb et al, 1983; Calabrese et al, 1986; Sluzewska et al, 1996; Song et al, 1998; Howren et al, 2009; Dowlati et al, 2010; Liu et al, 2012b; Valkanova et al, 2013; Black and Miller, 2015; Haapakoski et al, 2015; Eyre et al, 2016; Goldsmith et al, 2016b; van Dooren et al, 2016) .
This has been shown in studies examining the acute behavioral and CNS responses to a single exposure to endotoxin or typhoid vaccine and even more convincingly by the many studies examining the biological and behavioral effects of chronic immune activation secondary to treatment with the cytokine IFN-α for either cancer or hepatitis C virus infection (Capuron et al, 2002 (Capuron et al, , 2003a (Capuron et al, , 2003b (Capuron et al, , 2005 (Capuron et al, , 2007 (Capuron et al, , 2009 Wichers and Maes, 2004; Wichers et al, 2005b Wichers et al, , 2006 Wichers et al, , 2007 Majer et al, 2008; Harrison et al, 2009a Harrison et al, , 2009b Lotrich, 2009; Lotrich et al, 2009; Prather et al, 2009; Raison et al, 2009 Raison et al, , 2010a Raison et al, , 2010b Raison et al, , 2010d Eisenberger et al, 2010a, b; Franzen et al, 2010; Felger et al, 2011 Felger et al, , 2012 .
And while chronic stress is best known to suppress certain aspects of immune function (ie, natural killer cell activity, circulating T-cell subsets; Herbert and Cohen, 1993c) , the types of acute and/ or psychosocial stressors most likely to be associated with immediate risk of wounding and hence infection activate both innate and adaptive immunity (Quan et al, 2001; Bierhaus et al, 2003; Avitsur et al, 2005; Viswanathan et al, 2005; Pace et al, 2006b; Steptoe et al, 2007; Joachim et al, 2008; Bailey et al, 2009; Rosenberger et al, 2009; Mays et al, 2010; Powell et al, 2010) .
A number of viruses have been reported to be restricted by BST2, including retroviruses (alpha-, beta-, delta-, lenti-, and spuma-) (Jouvenet et al., 2009) , arenaviruses (Lassa virus and Machupo virus) (Radoshitzky et al., 2010; Sakuma et al., 2009) , herpesviruses (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human simplex virus) (Blondeau et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Mansouri et al., 2009; Zenner et al., 2013) , filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009) , rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis virus) (Weidner et al., 2010) , paramyxoviruses (Nipah virus), orthomyxoviruses (influenza A virus) (Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , and flaviviruses (Dengue virus) (Pan et al., 2012) .
The availability of genotyping data across all CC lines opened the way to analyses of QTLs in a variety of traits, including behavioral and morphological phenotypes (Aylor et al., 2011; Chesler, 2014; Mao et al., 2015; Percival et al., 2016) , homeostatic immune processes (Kelada et al., 2012; Phillippi et al., 2014) , susceptibility to infectious diseases (Durrant et al., 2011; Ferris et al., 2013; Vered et al., 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Gralinski et al., 2015; Lorè et al., 2015) , and liver-related functionalities (Kelada et al., 2012; Svenson et al., 2012; Thaisz et al., 2012) .
Attenuated vectors derived from VSV have been used extensively as experimental vaccine candidates (Daddario-DiCaprio et al., 2006a,b; Egan et al., 2004; Geisbert et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005; Kahn et al., 2001; Natuk et al., 2006; Palin et al., 2007; Ramsburg et al., 2004; Reuter et al., 2002; Roberts et al., 1999 Roberts et al., , 1998 Roberts et al., , 2004 Rose et al., 2001; Schlereth et al., 2003 Schlereth et al., , 2000 .
Our laboratory is using functional genomics to study a variety of viruses, including HCV, SIV/HIV, Ebola virus, HSV, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus (Baas et al., 2006a,b; Baskin et al., 2004; Fredericksen et al., 2004; Geiss et al., 2000 Geiss et al., , 2001 Geiss et al., , 2002 Geiss et al., , 2003 Kash et al., 2004 Kash et al., , 2006a Kobasa et al., 2007; Lederer et al., 2006; Pasieka et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2003a Smith et al., ,b, 2006 Thomas et al., 2006; Walters et al., 2006 Walters et al., , 2006a .
Causes of CD4 + cell loss include decreased production secondary to bone marrow or thymic infection, lysis of infected cells induced by FIV itself (cytopathic effects), destruction of virus-infected cells by the immune system, or death by apoptosis (cell death that follows receipt of a membrane signal initiating a series of programmed intracellular events) (Bishop et al., 1993; Ohno et al., 1993 Ohno et al., , 1994 Johnson et al., 1996; Guiot et al., 1997a,b; Mizuno et al., 1997; Mortola et al., 1998a,b; Piedimonte et al., 1999; Mizuno et al., 2001 Mizuno et al., , 2003b Tompkins et al., 2002) .

"In the last decades, several viruses emerged, after cross-species passage from animal reservoirs and then spreading in human populations; the Ebola virus, two different coronaviruses causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and the Nipah virus, are paradigmatic examples of biological agents completely new for humans, with high epidemic potential, but also prone to disappear in case early detection and intervention are ensured (Morse 1993; Fauci and Morens 2012) .
Because technologies used for viral discovery can be prohibitively expensive and require a high level of expertise, PREDICT virologists compiled a set of relatively simple and inexpensive protocols for the detection of known and novel viruses within viral families that had previously been recognized in animal hosts and known to cause human disease outbreaks, and coupled this cost-effective approach with the selected application of high through-put sequencing (Anthony et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2013a; Goldstein et al., 2013) .
In this review, we will discuss the host species barrier for these viruses, concentrating on three questions: how does HPAI H5N1 virus transmit from birds to humans; what are the within-host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus and pH1N1 virus in humans and other mammals; and what determines transmission of influenza viruses among humans.
Also, the difference in pattern of virus attachment between HPAI H5N1 virus and seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses fits with the difference in primary disease presentation: tracheo-bronchitis for seasonal human influenza viruses, and diffuse alveolar damage for HPAI H5N1 virus infection.
We used avian influenza viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, to represent inefficiently transmitted viruses; and seasonal human H1N1 virus, seasonal human H3N2 virus, and pH1N1 virus to represent efficiently transmitted viruses [24] .
Four more human coronaviruses have been isolated and described so far: HCoV NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Abdul-Rasool and Fielding, 2010) , HCoV HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a; Lau et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006) , SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , and MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) .
The UbV development platform can also be readily extended to target viruses that infect plants and animals of economic importance, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, equine arteritis virus, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus, all of which encode vDUBs that are essential for virus replication [22] .
Ciliary loss of the upper respiratory tract has also been described in other viral infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐CoV in humans (Nicholls et al., 2003), respiratory syncytial virus in humans (Jumat et al., 2015), influenza virus in humans and ferrets (Zeng et al., 2013) and canine respiratory coronavirus in dogs (Mitchell et al., 2013).

"By incorporating a 'delay to ICU' parameter within our model, that can take on negative values (thus indicating a diagnosis after ICU admission), we hope to have replicated the anecdotal experience of clinicians in these early phases of the pandemic; that a substantial proportion of patients are being con- forecast numbers as these data inform our standardised estimates of ICU cases from within each population [9] .
If China's policies aimed at achieving suppression represent a maximum possible reduction in transmission from initially high rates, then estimates based on their curve will undercount both the total deaths and maximum death rates for other countries and hence represent a reasonable lower bound for modelling: the lowest estimate of total deaths in the models in Ferguson et al.
Scientists also believe that peri-domestic mammals may also serve as For long, human viruses have not been considered severe pathogens as infected people develop flu like symptoms and then get cured on their own as innate immune system triggers antibody formation that provides resistance against the diseases (Chiu, 2013; Kistler et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008) .
al [34] , the reproduction number of the disease for the 187 vaccinated SIR model is given by to the existence of another compartment I 2 for those who are infected with the new 196 strain, which we will refer to as Disease 2.
19.20039198 doi: medRxiv preprint of the second strain, the proportion of the population infected by the original strain, i 1 , 368 and the proportion of the individuals who recovered from the original strain, r 1 , 369 decrease and go to zero asymptotically.
Based on the stability of the first three equilibrium points 387 and the existence criterion, the endemic equilibrium point is expected to be stable when 388
This implies that the endemic equilibrium for the two strains can only occur when 389 the system is initially in endemic equilibrium for the original strain, which can explain 390 why the condition is more restrictive than the one for the equilibrium with Disease 2. .
After establishing the possible transitions between compartments, the 459 system was found to have four equilibrium points: the disease free equilibrium, the 460 existing strain equilibrium, the emergent strain equilibrium, and the endemic 461 equilibrium.
495
Based on the results, we found that the original and the emergent strain can coexist in 496 an endemic equilibrium if the emergent strain has a lower reproduction number than 497 the original strain and that the system should already be in endemic equilibrium with 498 the original disease before the emergence.

"To determine whether hematopoietic cell lines can support replication of Sabin poliovirus type 1, cells were infected with an MOI of 1 and cells together with supernatant were harvested at day 3 (for all virus passages in Vero cells and for passages 3-5 on U937 cells) or day 6 after infection.
Since we already observed that also other Sabin poliovirus types are capable of replicating in the permissive three cell lines (Oosterhoff et al., unpublished data) and that all cell lines express other viral receptors, needed for efficient infection with rhinovirus, coxsackie, adenovirus, and hepatitis C virus, it would thus be interesting to determine the capacity of these viruses to replicate in these cell lines.
The dynamic and multifunctional nucleolar proteome enables ribosome subunit biosynthesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA replication/repair, RNP biogenesis, and stress response within subnucleolar compartments—fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar components (DFC), and outermost granular components (GC).24,25
Viral pathogenesis induces cellular stress, leading to transformation in nucleolar proteomic morphology as nucleolar-accessible viral proteins recruit replication factors.26,27 Similar to HIV-1 Rev, the following single-strand RNA viruses express nucleolar RNA binding proteins of diverse functionality: severe acute respiratory coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) harbors an NES predicted in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity28; dengue virus core protein facilitates encapsidation and potentially modulates transcription29; and the Semliki Forest virus nonstructural protein (nsP2) regulates viral mRNA synthesis.30
Although nucleolar trafficking is prevalent in many viral infectious models, the purpose of this localization pattern is unknown.
In a wastewater sample spiked with viruses, the nondimensional concentration of infective viruses in the wastewater liquid C l,ww * is related to the fraction of viruses inactivated in the liquid phase (ξ 1 *), and the fraction reversibly adsorbed to wastewater solids (ξ 2 *):
The change of the viral fraction in the liquid and solid phases with time can be described with the following set of differential equations:
where, ξ 3 * is the fraction of viruses inactivated on the solid surface; τ is the nondimensional time, equal to k 1 t; n sro * is the initial amount of viruses reversibly adsorbed to solids (assumed zero in the study); N b = k 2 /k 1 , where k 2 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for reversible virus adsorption; N s = (k 3 +k 4 )/k 3 , where k 3 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for virus inactivation at the solid surface and k 4 (h −1 ) is the rate constant for the conversion of reversibly adsorbed viruses to an irreversibly adsorbed state;
is the rate constant for virus desorption from solid phase to liquid phase, W (g) is the mass of solids, and V (L) is the liquid volume.
The antiviral assays [except anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assays] were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in HEL [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Coxsackie B4, and Punta Toro virus), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus), MDCK (influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and B virus) and CrFK (feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus) cell cultures.
These include: (1) primary inefficient transmission via sexual and transplacental routes but effective transmission via blood; (2) primary replication in renewable populations of lymphoidal cells with production of large amounts of virus after the initial infection of the host followed by persistent low level of viremia in spite of antiviral immune responses; (3) persistence, reflecting continuous rounds of productive, cytocidal infection of permissive cells [59, 74] and the rate of generation of permissive cells which may be the main factor in determining the level of virus production (in the case of HIV, the rate of activation of CD4 § T cells to support a productive HIV replication might be the factor determining the rate of virus production and the progression of the disease); (4) rapid antibody formation but delayed production of neutralizing antibodies with limited neutralizing capacity; (5) rapid but transient generation of virus-specific CTLs; and (6) accumulation of large amounts of virus in newly formed germinal centers in the spleen and lymph nodes concomitant with an initiation of a permanent polyclonal activation of B cells resulting in an elevation of plasma IgG2a.
For the lectin array analysis, cells (C6/36 cells, Vero cells, SNB-19 cells, and JEG-3 cells) grown until they reached 60–70% confluency were incubated with various ZIKV strains, such as African strains (MR766 and IbH), Asian strains (PRVABC59 and FLR), and the primary Brazilian isolate SJRP, at MOI of 1 in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 90 min, and control uninfected (no virus added) cells were maintained under similar conditions.
After the infection (similar infection conditions were followed), the uninfected cells and ZIKV-infected cells, separately, were harvested using cell scrapper, made into a single cell suspension, and counted using cell countess (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

It would be interesting to further investigate the functional importance of L-SIGN in vivo SARS infections using In acute lung injury, such as acid aspiration, pneumonia, or sepsis, the generation of ANG II from ANG I is enhanced by ACE, and ANG II induces acute lung failure through stimulation of the AT1 receptor, while ACE2 and ANG II type 2 receptor negatively regulate this pathway and protect from acute lung failure.
A new chapter of the RAS, now dealing with critical illness, is being written and opens the door to a new concept in the manipulation of this ubiquitous system: inhibition in the chronic setting but activation in the acute setting.The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinically important complication of severe acute lung injury (ALI) in humans, highly associated with sepsis pneumonias and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1] [2] [3] .
Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical usefulness of Prime-Oglucosylcimifugin.Study of biomarkers of various diseases will help to improve the management in three ways:By providing a better understanding of the disease pathomechanismBy improving the diagnosis and determining the prognosisBy providing a basis for development of therapeutics and monitoring the effect of therapeutics on the disease

Biomarkers that will be useful for either disease prediction or treatment should have one or more of several properties, includingSpecific and selective association with illness in a populationHeritabilityIndependently indicate the presence of the disease regardless of the presence or absence of the clinical phenotypeCo-segregation with disease within familiesPresence in relatives of affected individuals at a higher rate than in the general population

A biomarker should fulfill three criteria to be useful clinically:Accurate, repeated measurements must be available to the clinician at a reasonable cost and with short turnaround times.The biomarker must provide information that is not already available from a careful clinical assessment.The measured level should aid in medical decision making.
Biomarkers for SLE include Fc receptor genes (disease susceptibility), complement C4d-bound erythrocytes (diagnosis or disease activity), CD27 plasma cells (disease activity), “interferon signature” (disease activity), and anti-C1q antibodies (disease activity and organ involvement).

As more and more cats are kept as pets in many countries, studies of cats in the home setting and studies comparing the welfare of indoor-only cats with that of cats allowed outdoors, are urgently needed.Global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have led many countries to reinforce the entry screening systems at their international airports, ports, and border lines as a way to prevent or delay the spread of infectious diseases across countries [1-4].
Interestingly, although there were significantly more young TCR Tg CD4 + cells in mice receiving young cells at day 7 after immunization, by day 14, the numbers of young and aged donor cells were equivalent; thus, differences in the numbers of helper T cells at this time point could not account for these results, suggesting differences in the ability to provide cognate help to B cells between young and aged CD4 + cells.
Outbreak investigations for any infectious or toxicant-induced disease involve an orderly process of characterizing the outbreak and finding solutions using epidemiologic concepts that include the following:
Interviewing key individuals Verifying the clinical diagnosis and assure that treatments are appropriate
Identifying the factors responsible for the outbreak using a rational diagnostic plan and qualitative or quantitative analytical methods Developing strategies to prevent new cases and future outbreaks by identifying corrective actions likely to have the most impact without excessive cost Communicating observations and recommendations with the key individuals, and using records to verify compliance and monitor progress.Harm reduction became the policy of choice when the 2004 Health Statistics of Taiwan identified injection drug users (IDUs) as the most rapidly expanding subgroup of newfound HIV-positive cases.
The baseline (HBM) model is a recursive, two-stage model:
Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility information, of personal sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention to get vaccinated ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
The alternate model we want to test is also a recursive, two-stage model:
Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
Note that stage 1 is the same for both baseline and alternative models.
Our final model (Table 2) included the following parameters for the date on which each faecal sample was collected: (1) the number of younger juveniles present at the communal den, the most naïve age class to Dipylidium infection; (2) the number of adults and older juveniles present at the communal den as an index of the number of adult fleas brought to the den and of the flea eggs these fleas were likely to shed at the den; (3) maternal standardised rank as an index of juvenile body resources; (4) prey abundance (3 levels: high, medium and low) as an index of current maternal input in terms of the interval between visits to nurse offspring at the den; and (5) juvenile age in days.
When fitting the models we penalized these regions of parameter space by arbitrarily assigning a deviation between model and data of 500 d.
We used the stochastic model to consider the effects of (i) reducing local transmission (this simulates the effects of isolation, behaviour changes, antiviral use, or other measures that may reduce the average number of secondary cases produced by one primary case); and (ii) restricting travel to and from affected cities.
We considered a number of other scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the results to the most important unknowns: patterns of seasonal variation in influenza transmission; variation in transmissibility between tropical and temperate regions; the proportion of individuals initially susceptible to the virus; the basic reproduction number, R 0 (defined as the mean number of secondary cases in a local and susceptible population caused by the introduction of one primary case); the distribution of the infectious period; the city in which the pandemic begins; and the date on which the virus first begins to spread.

"Especially in developing countries including China, ARTIs, mainly pneumonia, are the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 years.1,2 A great variety of pathogens can cause ARTIs, and viruses have been considered as the predominant pathogens in this children population.3,4 The most frequently reported viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (ADV), which are responsible for most episodes of ARTIs in children.1 In the past decade, several new viruses associated with ARTIs such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), novel strains of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HKUI), human bocavirus (BOV), WU polyomavirus (WUPoyV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPoyV) have been discovered in human respiratory tract specimens.
Overall, 48·0% of our cases were positive for respiratory virus infections, which resembled the latest study in the same city.21 A similar incidence rate has been obtained in neighboring regions13,22 and other cities such as Rome23 and Milan,24 but it was different from other studies.10–12 In China, the overall positive rate reported varied from 27·3 to 74·8% depending on different areas and detection methods.15,16,25–31 The rate of respiratory viral infections varied worldwide, and many factors such as geographic distribution, study design and detection protocols could lead to these variations.1,7,8,32 In our study, leukocyte count was used as an indicator of inclusion criteria and it probably affected the positive rate.
However, seasonal distribution was noted from September to February in Hong Kong38 and May and June in Guangzhou.39
The use of multiple PCR made it possible to simultaneously detect a broad spectrum of viruses with excellent sensitivity, at the same time, with increased viral detection rate and co-infection rate for ARTIs.12,40 Among our positive cases, co-infection rate was 31·1%, which was similar to 27·9% reported by Do et al.10 Co-infection rate reported elsewhere varied widely from 25·4 to 47·9%.40 The relatively lower co-infection rates ranging from 0·24 to 26·9% were reported in the studies conducted in various cities of China.22,25–31 In most of these studies, immunofluorescence kits were used to test a lower number of respiratory viruses.

For that purpose, several approaches have been described, by using biological reporters (Wadia et al., 2004; Lebleu et al., 2008) or phenotypic (Morris et al., 2007a) assays enabling to follow shuttling and release of the cargo in real time in cultured cells (Lee et al., 2008) or in animal models (Wender et al., 2007) Although it remains difficult to establish a general scheme for CPP uptake mechanism, there is a consensus that the first contacts between the CPPs and the cell surface take place through electrostatic interactions with proteoglycans, and that the cellular uptake pathway is driven by several parameters including: (i) the nature and secondary structure of the CPP; (ii) its ability to interact with cell surface and membrane lipid components; (iii) the nature, type and active concentration of the cargo; and (iv) the cell type and membrane composition ( Figure 1 ).
Moreover, type I IFNs also play important roles in immunoregulation by activating natural killer (NK) cells (Krug et al., 2004a) , modulating the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) (Lapenta et al., 2006; Longman et al., 2007) , B and T cells (Aichele et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2007b; Coro, Chang, and Baumgarth, 2006; Le Bon et al., 2006) , as well as finetuning DC development in the bone marrow (Zuniga et al., 2004) .
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a respiratory pathogen identified by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel test or any other upper respiratory pathogen diagnostic test ordered by the physician; the proportion of patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis; the proportion of patients receiving appropriate anti-influenza treatment or prescription in the ED by an emergency medicine clinician (composite rate of anti-influenza treatment in positive patients and nonuse of anti-influenza treatment in negative patients); the proportion of patients discharged home from the ED vs hospital admission; the proportion of patients with all-cause or respiratory illness-related repeat ED visit, hospital or ICU admission, or death within 30 days; clinician adherence to guidelines for the treatment of patients with influenza (recommendations for use of antivirals only); length of ED stay; length of hospital stay; time to influenza test results; and time to other respiratory pathogen test results.

The duration of infection in these studies varies from several hours (Vieler et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 1995; Kaya et al., 2006) to several days (Kuzan et al., 1989; Bhushan et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2011; Fei et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2014) or even months (Lucchetta et al., 1983; Hackett et al., 1988; Pilatz et al., 2015a) .
Immune cell infiltration of the epididymis of rat occurred as early as 24h post-infection (Tanaka et al., 1995) and by 3 days postinfection, leucocytic infiltration of the interstitial space (Hackett et al., 1988; Tanaka et al., 1995; Kaya et al., 2006; Lang et al., 2013) , and in some cases in the ductal lumen as well (Ludwig et al., 1997 (Ludwig et al., , 2002 Kaya et al., 2006) , was observed.
Animal models of viral infections of the male tract itself include mumps virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections in mice (Tebourbi et al., 2001; Malolina et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) , Sendai virus infection in rats (Melaine et al., 2003) , Myxoma virus infection in rabbits (Fountain et al., 1997) and simian immunodeficiency virus infection in monkeys (Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2005; Houzet et al., 2014; Winnall et al., 2015) .
In classical EAO, an autoimmune response is generated against antigens of haploid germ cells, spermatogonia, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and the basal lamina of the seminiferous tubules, causing complete loss of germ cells (Sato et al., 1981; Lustig et al., 1982; Adekunle et al., 1987; Tung et al., 1987b; Yule et al., 1988; Teuscher et al., 1994; Fijak et al., 2005) while in TGCelicited EAO autoimmunity is induced only against antigens of haploid germ cells (Itoh et al., 1994; Qu et al., 2010; Hirai et al., 2013; Terayama et al., 2016) .
Numerous trypanosome species have been identified in bats in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe (Hoare, 1972; Baker, 1973; Marinkelle, 1976 Marinkelle, , 1979 Gardner and Molyneux, 1988a,b; Hamanaka and Pinto Ada, 1993; Steindel et al., 1998; Barnabe et al., 2003; Grisard et al., 2003; Lisboa et al., 2008; Cottontail et al., 2009; Maia da Silva et al., 2009; Cavazzana et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2012 Lima et al., , 2013 Marcili et al., 2013; Silva-Iturriza et al., 2013; Cottontail et al., 2014; Ramirez et al., 2014) .
Nonetheless, other studies found contradictory results of no association of TNF-α − 308 G > A polymorphism with SLE among Argentinean (Muñoz et al., 2014), Mexican (Zúñiga et al., 2001), Japanese (Takeuchi et al., 2005), Colombian (Tobón et al., 2005), African Americans (Parks et al., 2004), Italian (D'Alfonso et al., 1996), Chinese (Fong et al., 1996), Thai (Hirankarn et al., 2007) and Portuguese (Santos et al., 2012) patients.
Under currently used research protocols, medium containing mouse derived fibroblasts and FBS is generally (Richards et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Park et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2012; Havasi et al., 2013; Soong et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014) , and clinical grade hESC lines have been established and cultured in xeno-free environments (Ilic et al., 2012; Tannenbaum et al., 2012) .

"Paired fecal samples were available from 25 clinically ill chimpanzees (11 from Ngogo and 14 from Kanyawara) during and before (fourth quarter of 2016) the outbreak period, and we tested these for a suite of respiratory pathogens using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) as previously described [10], which tests for influenza virus A (multiple subtypes), human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, coronaviruses (multiple subtypes), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, bocavirus, and the bacterial pathogens Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
On day 4 after infection, we found that higher frequencies of IL-10/GFP+ cells were NK1.1+ TCRb2 (NK cells), as compared to NK1.1+ TCRb+, NK1.12 TCRb2, and NK1.12 TCRb+ cells (NK cells 56%63% compared to NK1.1+ T cells: 5%61%, and non-NK non T cells: 12%61%, and T cells: 27%62%) (Fig.
It is possible that MCMV-specific, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells contribute IL-10 in the liver during this infection, although further characterization of IL-10+ T cells at this site is necessary as regulatory subsets of CD4+ T cells [50] and CD8+ T cells [51, 52] have been shown to also generate IL-10 in various contexts.
A panel of respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus A (pandemic influenza virus H1N1, seasonal influenza A virus H3N2) and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus 1 to 4, human adenovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), human bocavirus, mycoplasma and chlamydia, were also detected in these specimens with commercial real-time RT-PCR kits (cat.
Proliferation index was expressed as the percentage of labelled cells over the total epithelial cells using the following formula:
Proliferation index ¼ number of epithelial labelled cells Â 100=total number of epithelial cells
In the HE-stained sections apoptotic cells were identified using the following morphological criteria: cell shrinkage, acidophilic cytoplasm and condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin.
Our laboratory policy as well as recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization for a positive test result include the following: for a positive RT-PCR result, repeat the test using a second aliquot of the original specimen, and if positive, confirm the result by sending the specimen to a reference labo-ratory; or test the positive specimen by a second RT-PCR test targeting a different part of the genome, and if positive, confirm by a reference laboratory (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/f/pdf/app2.pdf).
Interestingly, using duck influenza A viruses to infect human airway epithelial cells, the viral antigen could only be detected in the ciliated cells, but not in the goblet cells, possibly due to the low SAα2–3Gal expression on the surface of goblet cells and a low MOI infection [19], [20].
Each assay was run in microtiter plates containing cell control wells (cells only), virus control wells (cells + virus), drug toxicity wells (cells + drug only), drug background wells (drug only) and experimental wells (drug or positive control + cells + virus).
