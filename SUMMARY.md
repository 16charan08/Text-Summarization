### This markdown contains summarized sentences for each cluster.

#### Steps in summarizing data.
*step1:-* Best "k" value will be obtained from knee-elbow curve. \
*step2:-* This "k" value will be passed to summarize data function. This function initially forms cluster based on "k" value given and labels for each document are appended to original dataframe. By grouping labels, "data_text" column is joined together. So finally we will be having only "k" number of rows in dataframe with each row representing each cluster in order.
