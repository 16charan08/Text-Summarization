## Summarized Data

### This markdown contains summarized sentences for each cluster.

#### Steps in summarizing data.
**step1:-** Best "k" value will be obtained from knee-elbow curve. \
**step2:-** This "k" value will be passed to summarize data function. This function initially forms cluster based on "k" value given and labels for each document are appended to original dataframe. By grouping labels, "data_text" column is joined together. So finally we will be having only "k" number of rows in dataframe with each row representing each cluster in order. \
**step3:-** Dataframe containing clusters will be parsed to do sentense tokenization and then sentense normalization for each sentense separately.This done by looping through dataframe, so it is done for each cluster at a time. \
**step4:-** After getting normalized sentences data vectorized(countvectorization) and matrix is returned.\
**step5:-** Matrix returned from vectorization will be used along with its "Transpose" to get similarity matrix(matrix x matrix.T).\
**step6:-** This similarity matrix is used to get scores of each sentense using "Text Ranking" algorithm which is from "networkx" package.\
**step7:-** From this scores are sorted and top 8 scores are selected to get indices from our original sentences list.\
**step8:-** Finally, using above indices top 8 sentences of each cluster are written into separate file. Thus at the end of the execution we will be having summarized text of each cluster in each file. 

#### Assumption: - Sentences are tokenized using sent_tokenize from nltk, so sentences in each cluster are according to this tokenization which in some clusters may not be appropriate.
#### Assumption: - Total clustered formed for 1% of data .i.e nearly 600 files are "10". I have tried to run this for 10% of data which is computationaly expensive,I have increased size of instance even though it kept on running straight 13 hours and didn't even get best clusters. So, I am attaching summarized sentences for only 1% data.

"Taken as a whole, studies suggest that MDD is associated with all the cardinal features of an inflammatory response including increased proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors and increased acute phase reactants, chemokines, and soluble adhesion molecules in peripheral blood (Lieb et al, 1983; Calabrese et al, 1986; Sluzewska et al, 1996; Song et al, 1998; Howren et al, 2009; Dowlati et al, 2010; Liu et al, 2012b; Valkanova et al, 2013; Black and Miller, 2015; Haapakoski et al, 2015; Eyre et al, 2016; Goldsmith et al, 2016b; van Dooren et al, 2016) .
This has been shown in studies examining the acute behavioral and CNS responses to a single exposure to endotoxin or typhoid vaccine and even more convincingly by the many studies examining the biological and behavioral effects of chronic immune activation secondary to treatment with the cytokine IFN-α for either cancer or hepatitis C virus infection (Capuron et al, 2002 (Capuron et al, , 2003a (Capuron et al, , 2003b (Capuron et al, , 2005 (Capuron et al, , 2007 (Capuron et al, , 2009 Wichers and Maes, 2004; Wichers et al, 2005b Wichers et al, , 2006 Wichers et al, , 2007 Majer et al, 2008; Harrison et al, 2009a Harrison et al, , 2009b Lotrich, 2009; Lotrich et al, 2009; Prather et al, 2009; Raison et al, 2009 Raison et al, , 2010a Raison et al, , 2010b Raison et al, , 2010d Eisenberger et al, 2010a, b; Franzen et al, 2010; Felger et al, 2011 Felger et al, , 2012 .
And while chronic stress is best known to suppress certain aspects of immune function (ie, natural killer cell activity, circulating T-cell subsets; Herbert and Cohen, 1993c) , the types of acute and/ or psychosocial stressors most likely to be associated with immediate risk of wounding and hence infection activate both innate and adaptive immunity (Quan et al, 2001; Bierhaus et al, 2003; Avitsur et al, 2005; Viswanathan et al, 2005; Pace et al, 2006b; Steptoe et al, 2007; Joachim et al, 2008; Bailey et al, 2009; Rosenberger et al, 2009; Mays et al, 2010; Powell et al, 2010) .
A number of viruses have been reported to be restricted by BST2, including retroviruses (alpha-, beta-, delta-, lenti-, and spuma-) (Jouvenet et al., 2009) , arenaviruses (Lassa virus and Machupo virus) (Radoshitzky et al., 2010; Sakuma et al., 2009) , herpesviruses (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human simplex virus) (Blondeau et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Mansouri et al., 2009; Zenner et al., 2013) , filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009) , rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis virus) (Weidner et al., 2010) , paramyxoviruses (Nipah virus), orthomyxoviruses (influenza A virus) (Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , and flaviviruses (Dengue virus) (Pan et al., 2012) .
The availability of genotyping data across all CC lines opened the way to analyses of QTLs in a variety of traits, including behavioral and morphological phenotypes (Aylor et al., 2011; Chesler, 2014; Mao et al., 2015; Percival et al., 2016) , homeostatic immune processes (Kelada et al., 2012; Phillippi et al., 2014) , susceptibility to infectious diseases (Durrant et al., 2011; Ferris et al., 2013; Vered et al., 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Gralinski et al., 2015; Lorè et al., 2015) , and liver-related functionalities (Kelada et al., 2012; Svenson et al., 2012; Thaisz et al., 2012) .
Attenuated vectors derived from VSV have been used extensively as experimental vaccine candidates (Daddario-DiCaprio et al., 2006a,b; Egan et al., 2004; Geisbert et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005; Kahn et al., 2001; Natuk et al., 2006; Palin et al., 2007; Ramsburg et al., 2004; Reuter et al., 2002; Roberts et al., 1999 Roberts et al., , 1998 Roberts et al., , 2004 Rose et al., 2001; Schlereth et al., 2003 Schlereth et al., , 2000 .
Our laboratory is using functional genomics to study a variety of viruses, including HCV, SIV/HIV, Ebola virus, HSV, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus (Baas et al., 2006a,b; Baskin et al., 2004; Fredericksen et al., 2004; Geiss et al., 2000 Geiss et al., , 2001 Geiss et al., , 2002 Geiss et al., , 2003 Kash et al., 2004 Kash et al., , 2006a Kobasa et al., 2007; Lederer et al., 2006; Pasieka et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2003a Smith et al., ,b, 2006 Thomas et al., 2006; Walters et al., 2006 Walters et al., , 2006a .
Causes of CD4 + cell loss include decreased production secondary to bone marrow or thymic infection, lysis of infected cells induced by FIV itself (cytopathic effects), destruction of virus-infected cells by the immune system, or death by apoptosis (cell death that follows receipt of a membrane signal initiating a series of programmed intracellular events) (Bishop et al., 1993; Ohno et al., 1993 Ohno et al., , 1994 Johnson et al., 1996; Guiot et al., 1997a,b; Mizuno et al., 1997; Mortola et al., 1998a,b; Piedimonte et al., 1999; Mizuno et al., 2001 Mizuno et al., , 2003b Tompkins et al., 2002) .

The arguments for high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in humans include (a) infection is commonest during the first 3 years of life (Hojlyng et al., 1984; Mathan et al., 1985; Addy an
d Aikins-Bekoe, 1986; Wolfson et al., 1985; Baxby and Hart, 1984) ; (b) outbreaks are uncommon except in daycare centres for the reason mentioned in (a); (c) the disease is less common
 and occurs only sporadically in adults because of frequent previous exposure, not age-related innate resistance, since diarrhoea, when it occurs, can be at least as severe in adults a
s in children (Hunt et al., 1984) ; and (d) the prevalence of diarrhoea appears to be less in neonates compared with infants of 6 months or older (Mata, 1986; Mathan et al., 1985) , be
cause of protection by maternal antibody resulting from the mother's own frequent exposure.

By the early 1960s, many viruses were known to cause tumors in animals (Javier and Butel, 2008) , but none had been identified in human cancers.
For many cases where virus infection has been examined in the context of macrophage depletion, an early/innate role for macrophages in control of the infection has been deduced (Ben-Na
than et al., 1996; Pribul et al., 2008; Rivera et al., 2007; Seiler et al., 1997; Zisman et al., 1970; Zisman et al., 1971) .
However, macrophage depletion also appears to affect the adaptive immune response to some viruses, including ectromelia virus, mouse hepatitis virus A59, and hAd vectors examined in mi
ce (Karupiah et al., 1996; Kuzmin et al., 1997; Kuzmin et al., 2001; Lieber et al., 1997; Shifrin et al., 2005; Wijburg et al., 1997) .
In most infection models using CCR2 -/mice there are increases in replication of the infectious agent compared to control mice, for example, infection with Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococ
cus neoformans, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, mouse cytomegalovirus, and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (Benevides et al., 2008; Blease et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2

"To improve the public health care, the Ministry of Health instituted eleven basic items of public health services in 2009, including the establishment of residents' health assessments, health education, health care of children, maternity patients, elderly and patients suffering from hypertension, type II diabetes and severe psychosis, vaccine inoculation and immunization, response to public health emergencies and assistance in sanitary control [16] .
However, since (1) the interactions between the 5′ and 3′ end of the genome facilitated by RNA or/and protein to form the replication complex and thereby to initiate replication have been well documented in numerous of RNA viruses [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54] and (2) the results from this study that the mutations in the 3′-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA were able to alter the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis, we postulate that the sequence mutations in the 3′-terminal region of (+)-strand DI RNA [5′ terminal region of (−)-strand DI RNA] may hinder the binding of proteins to this region and then block the interactions between the 5′ and 3′ end of the (−)-strand genome to constitute the replication complex that is required for (+)-strand synthesis.
Only one, Global Point of Care: Strategies for Disasters, Emergencies, and Public Health Resilience, contributed by 105 authors and produced by the POCT•CTR (10), covers POCT topics relevant to public health and vice-versa, such as biohazards, community preparedness, disaster caches, geographic information systems, global resilience, national guidelines, molecular diagnostics (an extensive seven-chapter section), needs assessment, rapid diagnosis of critically ill patients with life-threatening diseases, POC culture, public health policy, and strategies for enhancing resilience.
Not all public health educational programs, per se (identified by “PHP” in Table 2), were included in the survey, but on the other hand, 100% of 59 U.S. schools of public health, colleges of public health, and public health schools accredited by the CEPH were accessed and assessed successfully, and 100% of the states in the U.S. with public health educational programs were represented.
Accordingly, the statement asked stakeholders to commit to 1) sharing public health surveillance data by default when a public health need is identified; 2) using public health surveillance data responsibly, with the intention of protecting and improving the health of the population; 3) making the benefits explicit; 4) ensuring that public health surveillance data are shared with as few restrictions as possible and in an ethical way.

As more and more cats are kept as pets in many countries, studies of cats in the home setting and studies comparing the welfare of indoor-only cats with that of cats allowed outdoors, are urgently needed.Global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have led many countries to reinforce the entry screening systems at their international airports, ports, and border lines as a way to prevent or delay the spread of infectious diseases across countries [1-4].
Interestingly, although there were significantly more young TCR Tg CD4 + cells in mice receiving young cells at day 7 after immunization, by day 14, the numbers of young and aged donor cells were equivalent; thus, differences in the numbers of helper T cells at this time point could not account for these results, suggesting differences in the ability to provide cognate help to B cells between young and aged CD4 + cells.
Outbreak investigations for any infectious or toxicant-induced disease involve an orderly process of characterizing the outbreak and finding solutions using epidemiologic concepts that include the following:
Interviewing key individuals Verifying the clinical diagnosis and assure that treatments are appropriate
Identifying the factors responsible for the outbreak using a rational diagnostic plan and qualitative or quantitative analytical methods Developing strategies to prevent new cases and future outbreaks by identifying corrective actions likely to have the most impact without excessive cost Communicating observations and recommendations with the key individuals, and using records to verify compliance and monitor progress.Harm reduction became the policy of choice when the 2004 Health Statistics of Taiwan identified injection drug users (IDUs) as the most rapidly expanding subgroup of newfound HIV-positive cases.

Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility information, of personal sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention to get vaccinated ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
The alternate model we want to test is also a recursive, two-stage model:
Perceived threat from disease ϭ f (Credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, past behavior, demographics)
Intention ϭ f (Residual of perceived threat from disease, credibility of mass media information sources, credibility of personal information sources, cost Ϫ benefit of future behavior, demographics)
Note that stage 1 is the same for both baseline and alternative models.
Our final model (Table 2) included the following parameters for the date on which each faecal sample was collected: (1) the number of younger juveniles present at the communal den, the most naïve age class to Dipylidium infection; (2) the number of adults and older juveniles present at the communal den as an index of the number of adult fleas brought to the den and of the flea eggs these fleas were likely to shed at the den; (3) maternal standardised rank as an index of juvenile body resources; (4) prey abundance (3 levels: high, medium and low) as an index of current maternal input in terms of the interval between visits to nurse offspring at the den; and (5) juvenile age in days.
When fitting the models we penalized these regions of parameter space by arbitrarily assigning a deviation between model and data of 500 d.
We used the stochastic model to consider the effects of (i) reducing local transmission (this simulates the effects of isolation, behaviour changes, antiviral use, or other measures that may reduce the average number of secondary cases produced by one primary case); and (ii) restricting travel to and from affected cities.
We considered a number of other scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the results to the most important unknowns: patterns of seasonal variation in influenza transmission; variation in transmissibility between tropical and temperate regions; the proportion of individuals initially susceptible to the virus; the basic reproduction number, R 0 (defined as the mean number of secondary cases in a local and susceptible population caused by the introduction of one primary case); the distribution of the infectious period; the city in which the pandemic begins; and the date on which the virus first begins to spread.

"Especially in developing countries including China, ARTIs, mainly pneumonia, are the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 years.1,2 A great variety of pathogens can cause ARTIs, and viruses have been considered as the predominant pathogens in this children population.3,4 The most frequently reported viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (ADV), which are responsible for most episodes of ARTIs in children.1 In the past decade, several new viruses associated with ARTIs such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), novel strains of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HKUI), human bocavirus (BOV), WU polyomavirus (WUPoyV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPoyV) have been discovered in human respiratory tract specimens.
Overall, 48·0% of our cases were positive for respiratory virus infections, which resembled the latest study in the same city.21 A similar incidence rate has been obtained in neighboring regions13,22 and other cities such as Rome23 and Milan,24 but it was different from other studies.10–12 In China, the overall positive rate reported varied from 27·3 to 74·8% depending on different areas and detection methods.15,16,25–31 The rate of respiratory viral infections varied worldwide, and many factors such as geographic distribution, study design and detection protocols could lead to these variations.1,7,8,32 In our study, leukocyte count was used as an indicator of inclusion criteria and it probably affected the positive rate.
However, seasonal distribution was noted from September to February in Hong Kong38 and May and June in Guangzhou.39
The use of multiple PCR made it possible to simultaneously detect a broad spectrum of viruses with excellent sensitivity, at the same time, with increased viral detection rate and co-infection rate for ARTIs.12,40 Among our positive cases, co-infection rate was 31·1%, which was similar to 27·9% reported by Do et al.10 Co-infection rate reported elsewhere varied widely from 25·4 to 47·9%.40 The relatively lower co-infection rates ranging from 0·24 to 26·9% were reported in the studies conducted in various cities of China.22,25–31 In most of these studies, immunofluorescence kits were used to test a lower number of respiratory viruses.

Other protein-derived peptides such as VP22 protein from Herpes Simplex Virus (Elliott and O'Hare, 1997) , pVec (Elmquist et al., 2001) , calcitoninderived peptides (Schmidt et al., 1998; Krauss et al., 2004) , antimicrobial peptides Buforin I and SynB (Park et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000) , as well as polyproline sweet arrow peptide (Pujals et al., 2006) have also been successfully used to improve the delivery of covalently linked cargos (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004; El-Andaloussi et al., 2005; Murriel and Dowdy, 2006) .
For that purpose, several approaches have been described, by using biological reporters (Wadia et al., 2004; Lebleu et al., 2008) or phenotypic (Morris et al., 2007a) assays enabling to follow shuttling and release of the cargo in real time in cultured cells (Lee et al., 2008) or in animal models (Wender et al., 2007) Although it remains difficult to establish a general scheme for CPP uptake mechanism, there is a consensus that the first contacts between the CPPs and the cell surface take place through electrostatic interactions with proteoglycans, and that the cellular uptake pathway is driven by several parameters including: (i) the nature and secondary structure of the CPP; (ii) its ability to interact with cell surface and membrane lipid components; (iii) the nature, type and active concentration of the cargo; and (iv) the cell type and membrane composition ( Figure 1 ).
Moreover, type I IFNs also play important roles in immunoregulation by activating natural killer (NK) cells (Krug et al., 2004a) , modulating the functions of dendritic cells (DCs) (Lapenta et al., 2006; Longman et al., 2007) , B and T cells (Aichele et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2007b; Coro, Chang, and Baumgarth, 2006; Le Bon et al., 2006) , as well as finetuning DC development in the bone marrow (Zuniga et al., 2004) .
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a respiratory pathogen identified by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel test or any other upper respiratory pathogen diagnostic test ordered by the physician; the proportion of patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis; the proportion of patients receiving appropriate anti-influenza treatment or prescription in the ED by an emergency medicine clinician (composite rate of anti-influenza treatment in positive patients and nonuse of anti-influenza treatment in negative patients); the proportion of patients discharged home from the ED vs hospital admission; the proportion of patients with all-cause or respiratory illness-related repeat ED visit, hospital or ICU admission, or death within 30 days; clinician adherence to guidelines for the treatment of patients with influenza (recommendations for use of antivirals only); length of ED stay; length of hospital stay; time to influenza test results; and time to other respiratory pathogen test results.

"Paired fecal samples were available from 25 clinically ill chimpanzees (11 from Ngogo and 14 from Kanyawara) during and before (fourth quarter of 2016) the outbreak period, and we tested these for a suite of respiratory pathogens using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) as previously described [10], which tests for influenza virus A (multiple subtypes), human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, coronaviruses (multiple subtypes), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, bocavirus, and the bacterial pathogens Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
On day 4 after infection, we found that higher frequencies of IL-10/GFP+ cells were NK1.1+ TCRb2 (NK cells), as compared to NK1.1+ TCRb+, NK1.12 TCRb2, and NK1.12 TCRb+ cells (NK cells 56%63% compared to NK1.1+ T cells: 5%61%, and non-NK non T cells: 12%61%, and T cells: 27%62%) (Fig.
It is possible that MCMV-specific, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells contribute IL-10 in the liver during this infection, although further characterization of IL-10+ T cells at this site is necessary as regulatory subsets of CD4+ T cells [50] and CD8+ T cells [51, 52] have been shown to also generate IL-10 in various contexts.

In the HE-stained sections apoptotic cells were identified using the following morphological criteria: cell shrinkage, acidophilic cytoplasm and condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin.
Our laboratory policy as well as recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization for a positive test result include the following: for a positive RT-PCR result, repeat the test using a second aliquot of the original specimen, and if positive, confirm the result by sending the specimen to a reference labo-ratory; or test the positive specimen by a second RT-PCR test targeting a different part of the genome, and if positive, confirm by a reference laboratory (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/f/pdf/app2.pdf).
Interestingly, using duck influenza A viruses to infect human airway epithelial cells, the viral antigen could only be detected in the ciliated cells, but not in the goblet cells, possibly due to the low SAα2–3Gal expression on the surface of goblet cells and a low MOI infection [19], [20].

"Reinvigorating downregulated adaptive immunity during established chronic infections likely bears a lower risk of provoking pathological levels of proinflammatory cytokines or the excessive killing of infected cells than treating during acute infections at the peak of pathogendirected immune responses due to reduced numbers of antiviral T cells and multiple mechanisms of T cell downregulation, which are present in established chronic viral infections [17, [73] [74] [75] .
Cleaning is related to the clearance of foreign material from a surface or equipment, allowing the removal of some organic material and microorganisms by detergents.11,33 However, this process does not kill bacteria, which, under favourable conditions, can redeposit elsewhere and form biofilms.31 Consequently, cleaning must always precede disinfection and sterilization in order to eliminate infectious microorganisms.59 A significant amount of microorganisms is destroyed by the disinfection process, which involves the use of chemical agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds, aldehydes, alcohols and halogens, or radiation and heat.11,31,33,60 The control of hospital infection must involve both disinfection and sterilization processes and sometimes the use of aerosols to clean the air.11,33
A biocide can target different locations on a cell as it may interact with the surface, the bacterial cell wall and the outer membrane, or it may penetrate the cell, where it can cause reversible or irreversible changes by interacting with nucleic acids, inhibiting enzymes and cell growth.24,60 When choosing a disinfectant, several factors must be taken into account, such as its efficiency, compliance with regulations, user acceptability, instrument compatibility, the types of surfaces and medical equipment, and the pathogenicity, infection rates and persistence of the microorganisms.61 A disinfectant must be safe, easy to use and effective against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and should not leave toxic residues.31,61 The efficiency of the disinfectant depends on several factors, mainly surface characteristics (hydrophobicity, charge and roughness), the amount of organic and inorganic matter, temperature, pH, the chemical structure of the biocidal agent and the type of infection and pathogen.11,24,31 The mode of action of the disinfectant and the route of entry into the cell (porin channels in the case of hydrophilic disinfectants and the hydrophobic path for hydrophobic disinfectants) also play significant roles.24 The risk of infection of the room/surface/equipment must also be considered in the choice of the disinfectant, as well as its concentration and exposure time.24,62 Hospital areas should be defined according to the risk of infection in order to establish and promote proper cleaning/disinfection.
Alcohols such as ethanol have a long history of antiseptic use; around the 19th and 20th centuries phenolics and hypochlorites started to be employed and, later, quaternary ammonium compounds.66 More recently, the most common products have been chlorhexidine and silver salts, peroxygens, glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde.66,67
Alcohol disinfectants cause protein denaturation and are effective against vegetative bacteria, fungi and viruses, but have no effect on spores.61,68 Chlorine-releasing agents can oxidize membrane proteins and are very effective in removing biofilms from surfaces, requiring short exposure times for growth inhibition.57,61,68 However, these chemical agents are corrosive to metals and can be inactivated by the presence of organic matter.57,61,69 Moreover, in the last few years the use of chlorine has been associated with the formation of carcinogenic compounds and some pathogens have been shown to be resistant to chlorine.70 The aldehyde-based disinfectants disrupt proteins and nucleic acids by alkylation and have antimicrobial activity against spores, bacteria, viruses and fungi.61,64 Quaternary ammonium compounds and phenols solubilize the membrane and the cell wall.68 Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid promote protein denaturation, and are active against several groups of microorganisms and pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections.38,57,61,64 The mechanism of action of different disinfectant categories has been presented elsewhere in greater detail.64,71,72
Countless studies have been performed regarding the antimicrobial action and efficacy of different disinfectants.
Using proteomic and microarray analyses Cameron et al [22] showed that individuals who survived SARS-CoV infection had controlled innate immune, ISG and cytokine responses while individuals who progressed to severe disease demonstrated an uncontrolled innate immune response, with high levels of ISG and immunoglobulin expression, increased cytokine responses and poor antibody responses to the spike protein.
Therefore, studies in our and other laboratories suggest that VLPs are a promising approach as evidenced in preclinical studies for developing vaccines against viral pathogens including HIV-1, influenza, poliovirus, rotavirus, Ebola, Marburg, Norwalk virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003; Deml et al., 2005; Galarza et al., 2005; Grgacic and Anderson, 2006; Lobue et al., 2006; Mortola and Roy, 2004; Pushko et al., 2005; Quan et al., 2007a; Sun et al., 2009; Warfield et al., 2005) .
